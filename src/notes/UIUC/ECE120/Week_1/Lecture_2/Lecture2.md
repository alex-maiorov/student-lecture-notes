## Algorithm

definiteness

effective computability

finiteness

## Computer Language

120 and 220 uses C language

## ISA

Computer runs this code

## Microarchitecture

Implementation of ISA, e.g Intel "Coves", AMD Zen revisions, Arm Cortex

## ECE 120 progress

Bottom to Computer Language

## Representation

Representation's purpose is communication, not obfuscation

Pattern must represent one thing

Some patterns may represent nothing

0 to Vdd creates a bit

binary, powers of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 rather than 1, 10, 100 in decimal

To be good a representation must be efficient

## How many bits you need

Binary choice, 1 bit

$$ log_{2}(n) $$ bits needed

## Arithmetic

can represent up to 2^n - 1 for n bits

113     1

112/2 = 58 0

56/2 = 28 0

28/2 = 14 0

14/2 = 7 1

6/2 = 3 1

2/2 = 1 1

## Unsigned number addition

long addition but with base 2

Overflow may happen
